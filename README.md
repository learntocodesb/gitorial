# git Tutorial

## Instructions
Follow these one step at a time, swapping in a new driver and navigator each time.

## 1. Bird Profiles
There is a row of sample text. Let's list some of our beautiful birds
so the world can see our majestic parrot collection!

The `img` folder contains 7 parrot pictures, named `parrot1.jpg`, 2, 3, etc. Add the first 3 parrots to the index page. Include their name and picture.

Their names are:
Lester
Pepe
Pete

## 2. Image size
The images don't quite look right. Let's get some consistency and clean this up! Open up `css/main.css` and set a uniform `width` to the bird images.

## 3. More rows
Add more rows (3 profiles per row) as needed to add the remaining birds' profiles.

Parrot 4-7's names are:
Sunny
Paco
Tweety
Louie

## Bird Price
Exotic birds aren't cheap! Add the following prices to each bird's listing:

Lester - $45
Pepe   - $30
Pete   - $170
Sunny  - $50
Paco   - $100
Tweety - $45
Louie  - $50


## How would you improve it?
Pick a product owner from the group to figure out what the Polly Parrot Co customers want! Take a minute to create a backlog, and work down the list.
